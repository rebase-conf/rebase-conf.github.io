  abstract: Judging by the experiences of Robert Grimm and a close confidante, both
    academe and industry have long given up even trying to conduct their business
    in an ethical fashion. In this talk, the author will detail some of the most egregious
    instances of deeply unethical if not outright criminal behavior across their career,
    will argue that they are representative of elites acting in a deeply irresponsible
    and self-serving manner, causally tie that misbehavior to the rise of nativist
    nationalism across the western world, and contrast it all against the civilization-ending
    threat of climate change. This talk sounds the alarm as much as it identifies
    our last best hope for survival. It’s up to us!

      But none of these qualifications and accomplishments are as relevant to technology
      today as his mother’s schooling on the history of the Shoah, him somehow surviving
      the years of the plague, and, more recently, coming within days of ending his
      life.

  abstract: 'Digital interfaces have changed a lot since the good old days of CERN''s
    first webpage. UI design has evolved in a very unpredictable way, generating new
    trends year after year always based on the needs and expectations of users. Also,
    in popular culture, we can find more and more user interfaces: TV shows, movies,
    comics and video clips are full of digital systems and it is very interesting
    to see how the media industry perceives the "shape" of technology and how it is
    used. From the colorful (and pixelated) iframe-based websites in the 90s to the
    minimalist and pretentious interfaces of 2020, we will take a journey through
    the trends, patterns and perception of mass culture of user interfaces, trying
    to understand how and why. they evolved in this way. Furthermore, we will try
    to understand why hackers in TV shows are able to break into the FBI''s servers
    by simply clicking a button.'

  video_id: bmUxwdxpXA0
  abstract: 'A *smart contract* is a script that controls the transfer of electronic
    assets within a distributed ledger. Existing smart contract architectures suffer
    from a *bottleneck* problem: contract calls place arbitrary user code right in
    the ledger''s critical path, so relatively complex contract executions delay processing
    for all transactions, especially simple payments and transfers that could otherwise
    be cleared quickly. This talk describes an alternative smart contract architecture
    that executes user code speculatively off the blockchain''s critical path. A secure
    committee validates and votes on each such computation, certifying the computation''s
    preconditions and its effects, and forwarding the certified results to a different
    committee controlling the blockchain. The paper focuses on the authors'' experience
    integrating this smart contract architecture with an existing commercial blockchain
    and an existing language virtual machine.'

  title: 'APIs are Illness and Cure: The Software Heterogeneity Problem in Web Programming'
  type: talk
  time1: Sun 11/15 6pm EST
  hashtags: APIs
  video_id: 5WN6Z1kHHIE
  abstract: It is easier than ever before to build complex web applications. But developer
    tooling for understanding, testing, and maintaining these systems has not caught
    up. Something I heard over and over again when starting Akita was that developers
    could log, measure, monitor, but they have a hard time understanding what was
    really going on with their software systems. A major challenge comes from the
    fact that modern web applications run across many heterogenous components, often
    communicating via remote procedure calls. Current software analysis methods do
    not work here, as network calls across heterogeneous components subvert language-level
    modelings. And using network tools alone do not yield the full picture. The result
    is that developers end up piecing the whole story together through reading code,
    logs, and documentation. At Akita, we observe that network-based application programming
    interfaces (APIs) are both a root cause of what we call the Software Heterogeneity
    Problem—and also the key to the solution. The proliferation of APIs for both internal
    and external use, with the rise of service-oriented architectures and the growth
    of the API economy, have made it easy to quickly build applications that are amalgams
    of cross-service network calls. At the same time, there is consolidation around
    a handful of interface definition languages for web APIs. This makes it possible
    for us to address the Software Heterogeneity problem by applying programming languages
    techniques at the API layer. In this talk, I will introduce the Software Heterogeneity
    Problem, show how we at Akita are solving this problem at the API layer, and outline
    API-level PL problems we can solve as a community.

    name: Jean Yang
    affiliation: Akita Software
    bio: 'Hi there. I’m Jean. I started Akita because I wanted to build practical,
      principled tooling for modern software systems. I’ve spent my career in pursuit
      of better software tools. I grew up programming—and it felt like magic that
      a kid like me could just conjure software. In college, I fell in love with programming
      tools: helping people make magic faster felt like pretty much the coolest thing
      a person could do. This was why I got my PhD in programming languages, at MIT.
      After that, I was a tenure-track professor at Carnegie Mellon University.  The
      whole time I was in research, I wanted to build tools that could majorly help
      practicing software developers. Early in my PhD, I got obsessed with two problems
      around this that I couldn’t solve using application-level techniques. First,
      the legacy software problem: you can’t just easily port most code to a fancy
      new language or type system. And even if you could, you run into the second
      problem: the heterogeneity of software systems. Modern software is an ecosystem,
      with your data stores, data streams, services, and third-party APIs. This is
      how I became obsessed with APIs: APIs let you encapsulate any code written in
      any language—and you can apply language design principles, just one zoom level
      up. This is why, while at CMU, I started doing research about APIs. This takes
      us to Spring 2018. Cambridge Analytica happened. GDPR was just about to come
      out. I realized that we were entering into a new era of software, where people
      were realizing that not having visibility or control over your software can
      hold you back in a major way. I called everyone on my LinkedIn who would talk
      to me and asked them about their tooling needs. When I realized there were big
      and interesting problems I was uniquely positioned to solve with my API tooling
      ideas, I just couldn’t miss out on the action. I took leave from CMU, sold my
      furniture, and drove across the country to the Bay Area to start Akita.'

  title: Quantitative Types in Idris 2
  type: talk
  time1: Tue 11/17  4pm EST
  time2: Wed 11/18  4am EST
  hashtags: Idris
  abstract: Dependent types allow us to express precisely *what* a function is intended
    to do.  Recent work on Quantitative Type Theory (QTT) extends dependent type systems
    with *linearity*, also allowing precision in expressing *when* a function can
    run. This is promising, because it suggests the ability to design and reason about
    resource usage protocols, such as we might find in distributed and concurrent
    programming, where the state of a communication channel changes throughout program
    execution.  Up to now, however, there has not been a full-scale programming language
    with which to experiment with these ideas.  Idris 2 is a new version of the dependently
    typed language Idris, with a new core language based on QTT, supporting linear
    and dependent types. In this talk I will show the benfits of QTT in Idris 2, in
    particular how it improves interactive program development by reducing the search
    space for type-driven program synthesis; and, how resource tracking in the type
    system leads to type-safe concurrent programming with session types.

  hashtags: CodeQL
  video_id: 31UD57d5Qdw
  abstract: In security, ‘variant analysis’ is the process of searching for variants
    of known vulnerabilities. This used to be done with grep and painstaking manual
    code audits, but it can be automated with a powerful semantic query language like
    CodeQL. The idea of such a query language had been around in academic research
    for a long time, but we had to create a startup named Semmle to make CodeQL reality.
    Semmle was acquired by GitHub in September 2019. I’ll show with a few in-depth
    examples how security researchers have used the CodeQL product to find and fix
    many vulnerabilities in popular open source projects. I’ll also discuss why the
    focus on variant analysis was a critical step in making Semmle a successful startup
    company. Finally, I’ll explain why the experience of creating Semmle and CodeQL
    convinced me that blue skies research goes fastest with user needs driving the
    research agenda.

    this with the on-going trend toward converting aviation hardware and mechanical
    systems to software, and the popular claim that aircraft are already more than
    half software, it is clear that the future of flight software faces a formidable
    challenge. The FAA provides regulations through documents such as DO-333, but
    little guidance as to how to achieve them. In short: for software to be certified
    to fly, the chance of a safety-critical failure must be less than one in a billion.
    So how do we do that? Particularly how do we achieve a sustainable, scalable schema
    for future avionics? We will overview the difficulties that face fabricating formidable
    flight software, break out the challenges facing future flight software, and pose
    possibilities for boldly going where no software has gone before.'

  title: Lies we tell ourselves about developer infrastructure
  type: talk
  time1: Mon 11/16  6pm EST
  hashtags: Python
  video_id: rPjybmePfdY
  abstract: Over the past decade "developer infrastructure" teams have become an increasingly
    common presence in industry. Focused on serving the unique needs of an organization's
    engineers, their responsibilities can be as modest as build script support or
    as ambitious as developing new general-purpose programming languages. As a practitioner
    they can be a wonderful place to work; a perfect environment to apply state of
    the art techniques to real world problems and invest in new ideas, all while keeping
    a tight feedback loop with a potentially massive user base. But with great power
    comes great responsibility, and the potential for waste is real.  How many build
    systems, UI frameworks, code review tools, and bespoke IDEs have been developed
    in industry because of “unique needs”? Of those, how many actually improved the
    state of the art or eventually provided a return on their investment? Why does
    conventional wisdom — or common sense — so seldom apply when we choose to pursue
    these sorts of projects? (Why is it so often easier to get funding to develop
    a new programming language than it is to make critical improvements to an aging
    but essential piece of infrastructure?) The truth is that we often build new developer
    tools not because they’re necessary, but because personally meaningful, easy to
    rationalize, and fun. While fun is great – I’m a big fan of it – we have a professional
    obligation to be honest about our intentions, use resources responsibly, and go
    into our work with open eyes. In this talk I aim to call out the most common sources
    of irrational exuberance when it comes to developer infrastructure, and the lies
    I've been told (or told others) to justify certain classes of projects. Where
    appropriate I'll provide cautionary tales from my last two decades working in
    the field (names will be changed to protect the innocent), sensible alternatives
    for those wiser than I was, and advice for those foolhardy enough to try and build
    that better wheel. (Because I guarantee you – whatever mistake you’re thinking
    of making, I’ve either made it myself or know someone who did.)

  hashtags: HPC
  video_id: BHRYRPkUFh8
  abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) systems are designed for pursuing extreme-scale
    parallelism and computational power to accelerate various computational-expensive
    applications in scientific computing. HPC software stack is deep and wide, mainly
    due to the complex computational requirements from various domain-specific algorithms
    and the diverse capacities provided by the underlying hardware architecture. For
    instance, domain-specific language or multi-layer runtime library is a common
    approach for developers to decouple the complex scientific algorithms from parallel
    programming (i.e., deep). To fully utilize different hardware components, different
    parallel programming models and runtime subsystems often coexist in an application
    software stack such as the popular MPI + “X” programming model (i.e., wide). Although
    abstraction allows developers and researchers to isolate innovations for different
    software components, experiences have indicated that co-design is the key strategy
    to achieve exascale computing and beyond. Co-design across the deep and wide HPC
    software stack is a very challenging task. However, the potential performance
    gain can be significant. In this talk, I will share the experiences and insights
    from several projects that explored the co-design approach across applications
    and parallel runtime subsystems.

  video_id: 7fgWgzw8DrE
  abstract: 'Intermittent computing is an emerging computational model that allows
    software to operate reliably on devices that harvest energy from their environment.  Energy-harvesting
    frees devices from the need for batteries, battery replacements, tethered power,
    and regular maintenance, enabling deployment to far remote installations, such
    as in civil infrastructure and outer space. This does not come for free: power
    failures impede progress and can leave a system''s memory and execution state
    inconsistent.  Unpredictable future energy availability, and the difficulty of
    precisely characterizing device power consumption makes building a reliable intermittent
    system a challenge.   I describe our experience with intermittent computing.  I
    describe our recent efforts to mathematically formalize the behavior of intermittent
    software execution, and lessons learned from these formal modeling efforts.  I
    discuss concrete incarnations of our intermittent and energy-harvesting computing
    results: a terrestrial, long-range batteryless camera system with the ability
    to do on-device machine learning and transmit over 10km distances with no batteries
    and two tiny, intermittent computing nanosatellites that sense, compute on sensor

  abstract: 'This talk will give a general introduction to Gillian, a multi-language
    platform for symbolic program analysis being developed by my team at Imperial
    College London. Gillian currently supports three types of analysis: whole-program
    symbolic testing; full verification based on separation logic; and automatic compositional
    testing based on bi-abduction. It uses a core symbolic execution engine, with
    strong mathematical foundations, that unifies bug catching and verification. To
    instantiate Gillian to a new target language (TL), the tool developer must provide:
    a compiler from the TL to GIL, an intermediate representation which is parametric
    on the TL memory model: that is, on the set of basic actions capturing the ways
    in which TL programs fundamentally interact with their memories; an OCaml implementation
    of the TL memory model using the basic actions; proofs of simple lemmas for the
    TL basic actions, if interested in correctness guarantees. So far, we have instantiated
    Gillian to JavaScript and C. These instantiations have been used to: find bugs
    in the real-world data-structure libraries Buckets.js and Collections-C; find
    bugs and prove bounded correctness results for a real-world jQuery-like library,
    cash; and verify the deserialisation function of the AWS Encryption SDK messaging
    system.'

  abstract: f(x) = y, but y = 5. What's the probability that x =1? Probabilistic programming
    is the idea of describing probabilistic models as programs, to then automatically
    infer how our beliefs about model parameters change given observed data. In recent
    years, probabilistic programming languages (such as Stan) have demonstrated the
    power of this approach by becoming the underlying tool behind numerous projects
    in social science, biology, genetics, astrophysics, and engineering. But why haven't
    such languages been more widely adopted yet? In this talk, Maria will talk about
    the nuts and bolts of probabilistic programming languages, addressing the challenges
    behind making these languages general-purpose, automatic, and efficient.

    in Julia'
  type: talk
  time1: Fri 11/20  4pm EST
  hashtags: Julia
  abstract: Fully incorporating differentiable programming (∂P) into the Julia language
    has enabled composability between modern machine learning techniques and existing
    high performance computing (HPC) modeling and simulation without sacrificing expressivity.
    Most notably, this has meant that small neural networks can be embedded within
    larger models whose other behaviors are fully understood and can be concretely
    represented. Smaller neural networks, in turn, are easier to train and interpret.
    It has also enabled complex computations to be embedded within cost functions
    for fast and robust reinforcement learning. In this talk, we’ll walk through several
    concrete examples and demonstrate how the combination of ∂P with Julia’s generic
    programming has enabled powerful and expressive new models.

  video_id: bzU-VEP9s78
  abstract: Performance clearly matters to users. For example, the most common software
    update on the AppStore is "Bug fixes and performance enhancements." Now that Moore's
    Law has ended, programmers have to work hard to get high performance for their
    applications. But why is performance hard to deliver? I will first explain why
    current approaches to evaluating and optimizing performance don't work. I'll show
    how complicated performance has become on modern systems, and how compiler optimizations
    have essentially run out of steam. Next, I'll introduce two radically new performance
    profilers that guide programmers directly to the code they need to change to improve
    application performance. The first is Coz, a new "causal profiler" for C/C++/Rust
    that lets programmers optimize for throughput or latency, and which pinpoints
    and accurately predicts the impact of optimizations via what we call "virtual
    speedup" experiments. Coz's approach unlocks previously unknown optimization opportunities.
    Guided by Coz, we improved the performance of applications by as much as 68%;
    in most cases, this involved modifying less than 10 lines of code and took under
    half an hour (without any prior understanding of the programs!). Coz now ships
    as part of standard Linux distros. The second is Scalene, a "scripting-language
    aware" profiler for Python. Scalene runs orders of magnitude faster than other
    profilers while delivering far more detailed information -- information that's
    especially valuable to Python programmers. Via a combination of sampling, inference,
    and disassembly of byte-codes, Scalene efficiently and precisely attributes execution
    time and memory usage to Python, which developers can optimize, or library code,
    which they cannot. Its novel sampling memory allocator efficiently reports line-level
    memory consumption and trends with low overhead, helping developers reduce footprints
    and identify leaks. Finally, Scalene reports a new metric, copy volume, that helps
    developers root out insidious copying costs across the Python/library boundary,
    which can drastically degrade performance. Scalene is available on PyPi.

  abstract: Debug information is a hidden and obscure component of our computing infrastructure
    obviously used by debuggers, but also playing a key role in program analysis tools,
    and, most surprisingly, in the runtime of programming languages. For instance
    C++ leverages DWARF stack unwind tables to implement exceptions!  Alas, generating
    debug information adds significant burden to compilers, and the debug info itself
    can be pervaded by subtle bugs, making the whole infrastructure unreliable.  Additionally,
    interpreting the debug tables is a bottleneck. My talk focuses on the DWARF unwind
    table, that enables stack unwinding in absence of frame-pointer information.  I
    show two techniques to perform validation and synthesis of unwinding tables, and
    their implementation for x86_64. Our validator has proven effective for compiler
    and inline assembly testing, while the synthesis tool can generate unwind tables
    for arbitrary binaries lacking debug information.  Additionally, I will report
    on a technique to precompile unwind tables into native x86_64 code, which we have
    implemented and integrated into libunwind, resulting in a 25x DWARF-based unwind

    evolves. In contrast, Truffle lets you define languages by simply writing their
    interpreter. That interpreter can be seamlessly combined with interpreters of
    different languages in a single just-in-time compilation unit. By treating the
    host language as just another language, you can reuse embeddings across languages.
    A language agnostic instrumentation mechanism enables us to build tools that attach

  abstract: "Borrowing from Thomas Kuhn's definition of a paradigm, Robert Floyd introduced
    the notion of a programming paradigm in his 1978 Turing Award acceptance speech.
    Ever since, this idea has infected the software world, becoming an organizing
    principle for jobs, conferences, and research. But further than that, it has become
    a ground for interminable debate and disagreement. \n\nIn order to help us understand
    this unfortunate situation, we will explore Thomas Kuhn's notion of a paradigm.
    Kuhn's paradigm is much richer than our ordinary everyday understanding; it is
    not merely a way of approaching problems, but is itself the system in which problems
    are made intelligible. We will discover the ways in which paradigm is apt for
    discussing the activities of the software world, and the ways in which our usage
    of the word deviates from its history. We will then explore these insights showing
    how they might apply in specific circumstances not typically considered. Finally,
    we will talk about philosophy's place in computer science's practice and possible
    avenues for further exploration.\n\n## What you will learn\n\nWe will not focus
    on the substance of debate between the various partisans of programming paradigms
    (object oriented, functional, and imperative being the most popular). Nor will
    we try to bridge the gap, finding some synthesis to make all parties agree. Instead
    we will explore the philosophy of science background that gave rise to these ideas.
    Focusing primarily on Thomas Kuhn, we will explore the notion of a paradigm and
    the ways in which paradigms are created, maintained, and discarded. \n\nNext we
    will evalute the ways in which our usage of paradigm aligns with Kuhn's. We will
    consider the ways in which this alignment impacts these programming paradigms
    debates and further consider Kuhn's notion of incommensurability. Can we borrow
    insights from the history of science to better understand our own practices? Can
    find a compelling reason for why these interminable debates seem to plague the
    software world at large? Next, we will consider ways in which our usage of paradigm
    diverge from that of Kuhn and consider other areas of software practice where
    Kuhn's ideas may apply more directly.\n\nFinally we will consider philosophy's
    impact on programming. Setting aside the ever popular discussions around Artificial
    Intelligence, we will begin by exploring how philosophy shaped foundational elements
    of computer science. We will explore under appreciated applications, especially
    those insights from Turing Award winner Peter Naur. Finally, we will look at areas
    where further insights may be gained in the future."

  abstract: Because of deep learning, there has been a surge in interest in automatic
    differentiation, especially from the functional programming community. As a result
    there are many recent papers that look at AD from a Category Theory perspective.
    However, Category Theorists have already been looking at differentiation and calculus
    in general since the late 60’s in the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry,
    but it seems that this work is largely ignored by those interested in AD. In this
    talk, we will provide a gentle introduction to the ideas of SDG, by relating them
    to dual numbers, and show how it provides a simple and purely algebraic approach
    to (automatic) differentiation.

  title: 'SQLancer: Automatically Finding Bugs in Database Management Systems'

  video_id: lCaGWSk5K3I
  abstract: This talk presents our work on automatic testing of Database Management
    Systems (DBMS), part of which we found over 400 bugs in widely-used DBMS such
    as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. While crash bugs in DBMS can be detected via
    fuzzers such as AFL, we aim to detect correctness bugs, which cause a DBMS to
    produce an incorrect result set for a given query. These bugs are more difficult
    to detect, since it is unclear how an effective test oracle could be created that
    could judge whether a given result set is correct. We designed three practical
    approaches for finding correctness bugs that we implemented as a tool called SQLancer.
    Besides providing a general overview of the bug-finding techniques, we will also
    present a number of interesting and surprising bugs that we found in the DBMS
    that we tested.

  abstract: "What does a movie about a monomaniacal quest to build an opera house
    in the Amazon Basin has to do with science? \n\nProgramming language research
    is at a crossroads. While formal language techniques are advancing steadily, the
    transfer of ideas to practice is much slower. Applied research is based on experimentation
    which is becoming prohibitively onerous. To evaluate any novel idea requires dealing
    with the complex language ecosystems of the day. Even the simplest innovation
    may take years of work to try out. Without a realistic evaluation, papers are
    rejected, and underlying hypotheses remain untested. Academic researchers are
    in a particularly precarious position. On the one hand, they must compete with
    industrial R&D teams with massively more resources, and on the other hand, they
    are beholden to an incentive system that rewards copious publication rates at
    select conferences. How can we build stuff that matters in such an environment?
    Are we doomed to failure? In this talk I argue that trying to build stuff is the
    necessary starting point, failure is expected and should be embraced, as, without
    it, we are not working on anything that matters. Based on my experience it is
    possible to navigate the academic system and come up with ideas that occasionally
    matter.\n\n**This talk is given by the recipient of the Dahl Nygaard Senior prize.**"

    bio: "Jan Vitek is a Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University.
      Dr. Vitek was born in Czechoslovakia and educated in Switzerland. Over the years,
      he worked on topics related to programming languages, their design, use, and
      implementation. With Noble and Potter, he proposed the notion of flexible alias
      control which became know as Ownership Types. He led the Ovm project which produced
      the first real-time Java virtual machine to be flight tested on a ScanEagle
      drone (he claims no one was harmed). Outcomes of this project include the Schism
      real-time garbage collector and the FijiVM – a production VM for embedded systems.
      More recently, he worked on dynamic languages, trying to make sense of JavaScript
      and to design a new language called, Thorn. Nowadays, he spends his time with
      statisticians and data scientists. Jan believes that his 2012 election as Chair
      of SIGPLAN was an accident; since has been busy trying to rock the boat to ensure
      this does not happen again. In his spare time, Jan enjoys organizing conferences
      and sitting on PCs (over 25 in the last decade). He founded the MOS (mobile
      objects), IWACO (alias control), STOP (gradual typing), and TRANSACT (transactional
      memory) workshop series. He was the first program chair of VEE and \nchaired
      ESOP, ECOOP, Coordination and TOOLS. He was the general chair of PLDI (in Beijing!),
      ISMM and LCTES. He may still be sitting on the steering committees of ECOOP,
      JTRES, ICFP, OOPLSA, POPL, PLDI, LCTES, ESOP."
